## Summary and Reflection

I separated the data from the design by creating simple classes for user details, education, and projects. I split the page into clear sections (Header, Contact, Education, Work Experience, and Projects) using basic Flutter widgets like ListView, Container, Row, and Column. I also added a background image and applied a consistent red theme across the app. I had a bit of trouble getting the grid images to fit just right, but I adjusted them until they looked good. Overall, everything worked as expected.

I enjoyed using Flutter's layout tools and making reusable parts of the app. It was fun to see how the design came together. The most challenging part was sizing the images in the grid correctly. I wish I had more time to add extra interactive features or animations. Overall, I learned a lot from this project and enjoyed building it.
